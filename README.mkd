Dojotools is intended to help in coding dojo sessions.


Our *huge* feature list is:

 - Watch a directory for changes and run a user supplied command
   when a file changes

 - Keep track of the round time (in the simplest way possible)


The only dependency is pygtk (to create the status icon), but if
you want notifications, you should also have pynotify installed.

Notifications, however, will not work very well in Ubuntu, since
Canonicalâ€™s Notify-OSD does not behave the same way as libnotify
does in other linux distributions.

You can revert to the old notification-daemon following instructions
in [this Ubuntu forums post][1] by [gradinaruvasile][2]:

> 1. Install the notification-daemon package:

>         sudo apt-get install notification-daemon
>
> 2. Rename the /usr/lib/notify-osd/notify-osd executable
>
>         sudo mv /usr/lib/notify-osd/notify-osd /usr/lib/notify-osd/notify-osd-original
>
> 3. Create a symbolic link:
>
>         sudo ln -s /usr/lib/notification-daemon/notification-daemon /usr/lib/notify-osd/notify-osd
>
> 4. Kill the original notification:
>
>         sudo killall notify-osd
>
> 5. Launch the new notification - press alt+F2, type /usr/lib/notify-osd/notify-osd
>
> 6. Test:
>
>         notify-send test test


We still need notifications for other platforms.
